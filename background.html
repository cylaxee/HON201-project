    	<h1>Background and Literature Review</h1>
    	<p>Numerous articles online have titles along the lines of: “tips for eating healthy with a busy schedule”; 
	    One article that is actually titled “Tips for eating healthy with a busy schedule” opens up with:
	  </p>
	<p>“Many students have a hectic schedule and often lack time to sit down to have a proper meal. 
		As a student myself, I often rush through meals, eat processed food to save time or even
		forget about eating. These poor eating habits lead to feeling tired, increase stress and
		weaken the immune system” (Yu, 2018). This article was written by a member at the UC
		Berkeley University Health Services (which shows the relevance of this research).
	  </p>
	<p>Some articles from journals on the topic of “diet” and “busy schedules” 
		all touch on the variables/factors that go into the relationship 
		between diet/healthy eating and so-called “cooking behavior.” One
		such article is titled “Factors influencing food preparation behaviours:
		findings from focus groups with Mexican-American mothers in southern
		California” (Smith, 2016); this article’s objective was explore food
		preparation behaviors, attitudes, meal planning, and shopping among
		Mexican-American mothers considered to be “primary food preparers.”
		The article touches on healthy meals by examining the high rate of
		obesity among Mexican-Americans.
	  </p>
	<p>Another article is titled “Food Agency in the United States: Associations
		with Cooking Behavior and Dietary Intake” (Wolfson, 2020). This article
		contains the line “evidence shows cooking frequently is associated with
		better diet quality and higher fruit and vegetable consumption” in the first paragraph;
	  </p>
	<p>I think that both of these articles are excellent sources of information
		for this project but neither discuss how university students are affected.
		I would like to learn more about the overall diet of college students (at PSU).
		My main question is:
	  </p>
	  <b style="font-size:24px:">How are PSU students’ diets affected by their busy schedules?</b>
