    <h1>Significance and Conclusion</h1>
    <p>The original journal articles I looked at regarding this topic both had a heavy emphasis
	    on the relationship between cooking and health observed in a certain group; I believe
	    that both of these studies ignored the university student demographic. I think that
	    there is value in exploring the relationship between the diets of specifically
	    university students and their schedules. This research would hopefully encourage
	    further research into this topic or a company to invest in healthier foods marketed
	    toward university students with busy schedules; In addition, I hope that this research
	    would encourage university students to open up more time in their schedules to dedicate
	    towards a healthier diet.<br><br>
	    Beyond the demographic of university students, this research would also highlight
	    the relationship between having a busy schedule (in general) and the perceived
	    healthiness of what an individual is eating. Further research into the topic of this
	    relationship could be conducted on various different demographics ranging from low income
	    families to single person households; again, companies could invest in some kind of new
	    product or restaurant chain or something marketed towards these groups.
