		<h1>Happy Coding</h1>
		<p>Hello world!</p>
    <br>
    <p>The general area being studied is “broadly recipes.” I want a way to incorporate my interest in trying and learning about new foods and potentially how to make them into this project. Generally, several factors come into play in deciding what someone will cook at home: how many people they are feeding, cost of ingredients, time allotted for cooking the food, knowledge and skill to cook various dishes, upbringing, available cooking equipment, and others. For myself, the most relevant of these factors are cost of ingredients and time allotted for cooking the food; this is because some ingredients are very expensive and would prevent most people from affording them; the other reason is that many people, including myself, do not have an entire day’s worth of time to cook and prepare whatever meal; many people are under a tight schedule and cannot be expected to cook an acceptable meal. I am interested in learning how people combat limited time for food preparation despite busy work/school lives; I imagine that many people do not cook at home and prefer to eat out due to their busyness; I imagine others may quickly prepare something of questionable quality or nutritional value. I think that people’s diets are very important and I want to know some of what the effect of lack of time has on people’s diets and what they choose to cook. In short: “How are people’s diets affected by their work/school life?”
