    <h1>Rationale</h1>
	<h3>Questions:</h3>
    <p>How are the diets of students at PSU affected by their busy schedules? <br>
	    Do students who cook for themselves consider themselves to have a
	    healthier diet than students who do not cook for themselves?
	</p>
	<h3>Claim:</h3>
	<p>Students who have a lighter schedule and cook for themselves 
		will have a healthier diet than students with busier schedules
		and do not cook for themselves.
	</p>
	<h3>Hypothesis:</h3>
	<p>Students who cook for themselves and have a lighter schedule will
		probably have a healthier diet because they have a greater
		opportunity to attend to their health than the students with
		busier schedules and do not cook for themselves. <br><br>

	If the topic of my hypothesis is confirmed, it would suggest
		that being less busy and cooking for oneself allows
		one to have a relatively “healthier lifestyle.” This
		suggested relationship may encourage students to attempt
		to allot more time to attending to their dietary needs. <br><br>

	If the topic of my hypothesis is disconfirmed, it would suggest
		that there is not a relationship between the busyness of a
		student’s schedule and the health of the individual based on their diet.
